my Recipe Website Project is a practical web development project that aims to create a comprehensive online platform for food enthusiasts and home cooks. This website will serve as a digital cookbook, offering some recipes from various cuisines, along with categorization by ingredients or diet.
Upon completion of this project, I will have demonstrated some of basic skills of html.
